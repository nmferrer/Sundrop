Android application designed to help users communicate and schedule gameplay sessions. Made using Java, Google Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Realtime Database.

Users can share their availability and interests. If one user finds another that suits their own preferences, then they can send an invitation to a play session for a specified time and date. If the user accepts the invitation, then a chat room is created for both users. Multiple users can participate in a play session.
